## INTRO

The PiWall Display Controller is a project focused on creating a versatile tool for managing content across multiple displays. 
This system aims to simplify control and overcome limitations of the current system, such as the inability to control displays over a remote distance. 
This project tackles this limitation by creating a versatile tool that seamlessly integrates Flutter's user-friendly interface with Python's robust backend.  

The PiWall Display Controller comprises several modules that work together to achieve seamless content management and display control. These modules include:

- User Interface Module (Implemented using Flutter)
- Content Management Module (Interacting with   Firebase Database)
- Network Communication Module
- Display Control Module (Utilizing Raspberry Pi)
